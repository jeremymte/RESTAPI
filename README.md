What is nodemon? 
    An alternative replacement for the command, node. Nodemon continually watches any application file that you change within your directory structure. And when it detects a change, it closes node and restarts it. In the past if you used 'noe' and then made a change to your code you would have to
        a. re-save
        b. go to your terminal and press CTRL-C to stop 'node' from running
        c. type 'node yourapp.js'

What is express?
    express is the default http/web framework for creating a web server for node js applications.  Express enables simplified creation of //routing// and //middleware// functions.

What is a route? 
    A route is a combination of a URL and a URI.  It is path/endpoint on a server which allows a programmer to define specific functionality (a function... middleware).

What is middleware?
    Middleware are functions that operate between the user requests and server responses.

What is mongoose?
    Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
